"# E-commeerce_power_Bi_project" 

-->Project Overview:

Atliq Hardware has been experiencing a steady decline in sales across its product line, and this project was initiated to identify the root causes of the issue. Using Power BI, I have created an interactive sales dashboard that visualizes various aspects of the company’s sales data, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

-->Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains historical sales records of Atliq Hardware’s products, including:

Product Information: Product ID, name, category, and price.

Sales Data: Sales amount, order date, and quantity sold.

Customer Data: Customer name, and purchase details.

Geographical Data: Region and location of the sales.

-->Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to analyze declining sales and provide insights to help Atliq Hardware optimize their sales strategy and improve overall business performance. The analysis includes:

Sales Trends Over Time: Monthly and quarterly sales performance.

Top and Bottom-Performing Products: Understanding which product categories are thriving and which are struggling.

Regional Sales Analysis: Which regions are contributing the most and least to sales.

Customer Segmentation: Analyzing customer purchasing behavior to identify trends and potential areas for targeted marketing.
